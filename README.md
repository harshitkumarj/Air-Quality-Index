# Air-Quality-Index

## Goals
**Can the data help to monitor the Air Quality Index ?**
The key question we look to answer is from the attributes provided in the dataset, can we predict the Air Quality Index.<br><br>
It is important to understand the behaviour of meteorological parameters in the planetary boundary layer because, atmosphere is the medium in which air pollutants are transported away from the source, which is governed by the meteorological parameters such as atmospheric wind speed, wind direction, humidity and temperature.

Air pollutants are being let out into the atmosphere from a variety of sources, and the concentration of pollutants in the ambient air depends not only on the quantities that are emitted but also the ability of the atmosphere, either to absorb or disperse these pollutants.
